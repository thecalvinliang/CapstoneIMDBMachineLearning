# CapstoneIMDBMachineLearning
This project uses the Large Movie Review Dataset to predict the sentiment of movie reviews as either positive or negative in Python using the Keras deep learning library.

The project was built using Jupyter Notebooks with Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). In order to view the code for this project you will need this software and libraries installed on your machine.

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing problem where text is understood and the underlying intent is predicted.

The dataset that we will be using is the Large Movie Review Dataset often referred to as the IMDB dataset. It contains 25,000 highly polar moving reviews (good or bad) for training and the same amount again for testing. The problem is to determine whether a given movie review has a positive or negative sentiment.

The data was collected by Stanford researchers and was used in a 2011 paper where a split of 50/50 of the data was used for training and test. An accuracy of 88.89% was achieved.
